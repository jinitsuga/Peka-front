# What's Peka, and why?

Peka (from Finn mythology Pekko/Pekka, god of crops) is a very simple social network, with the intention of allowing people that grow vegetables/fruits in their gardens to trade with each other, since it's very easy to have excess of X or Y vegetable while not being able to grow or have enough of another one, and where I live, it's quite common for people to plant at least one or two things in their garden.
Although I didn't have the knowledge to start tackling it when I started my coding journey, I thought it'd be an interesting thing to do, but now's the time! I also brought a great friend of mine along with me on this journey, who will be taking care of most of the backend while I study Node, which will allow me to pick his brain about some of the stuff. A challenging-enough project that'll be fun to create, and potentially leave something useful for our community in the process.

### New concepts to implement

Since Peka is a fairly ambitious and large enough project, I thought it'd be a good idea to start implementing at least a couple of new concepts:

- styled-components for styling. Took some time deciding between these and TailwindCSS, I really liked some aspects of styled Cs so we're going with it for now.
- Context API. While I have tinkered a bit with Context in the past, given the size of this project, it'll definitely be useful/needed, which makes this a great opportunity for getting more familiar with it.
