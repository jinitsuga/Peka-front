# What's Peka, and why?

Peka is a very simple social network, with the intention of allowing people that grow vegetables/fruits in their gardens to trade with each other, since it's very easy to have excess of X or Y vegetable while not being able to grow or have enough of another one, and where I live, it's quite common for people to plant at least one or two things in their garden.
Although I didn't have the knowledge to start tackling it when I started my coding journey, I thought it'd be an interesting thing to do, but now's the time! A challenging-enough project that'll be fun to create, and potentially leaving something useful for our community in the process.
